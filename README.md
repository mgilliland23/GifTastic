# GifTastic

This is a simple web app that uses the GIPHY API to fetch 12 gifs from a given TV show.

The user can either click on one of the pre existing shows' buttons or add a TV show of their own.

I used Bootstrap 4 for styling, and used a color scheme from the Nord Theme: https://www.nordtheme.com/
